# 2-Player Tambola Game 🎲
This is a simple 2-player Tambola game implemented using Python. The game generates tickets with 9 random numbers between 1 and 100 (both inclusive). Players need to mark the numbers on their tickets as they are called out randomly. The first player to mark all 9 numbers on their ticket wins the game. 🏆

# How to Play 🕹️
1. Run the Python script to start the game. 🚀 <br>
2. The game will generate tickets for both players with 9 random numbers each. 🎟️<br>
3. A button will be provided to generate random numbers between 1 and 100 (both inclusive). 🎰<br>
4. As each number is generated, players should check if it is present on their ticket. 🧐<br>
5. If a player has the generated number on their ticket, they should click on it to darken the number. ⚫<br>
6. The player who darkens all 9 numbers on their ticket first wins the game. 🎉<br>
7. Be attentive and alert to not miss any numbers, as once a number is called and missed, it cannot be darkened later. ⏰<br>
